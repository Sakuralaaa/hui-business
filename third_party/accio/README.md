```

### Use Manually

Each skill is a single `SKILL.md` file. You can copy it directly into your AI agent's skill directory:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/acciowork/agent-skills.git

# Copy the skill you want
cp -r agent-skills/accio-import-tariff-hs-code-calculator /path/to/your/agent/skills/
```

## How These Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file — a structured instruction set that tells an AI agent how to perform a specific task. The agent reads the file and follows the instructions, which typically include:

- **What the skill does** and when to use it
- **API endpoints** to call (powered by [accio.com](https://www.accio.com))
- **How to parse** and present results
- **Error handling** for edge cases

No backend setup. No API keys. No databases. The AI agent does all the work.

## Why Accio Skills?

| | Accio Skills | Typical Agent Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Zero — API call only | Often requires local servers, databases, or API keys |
| **Data** | Real-time from [accio.com](https://www.accio.com) APIs | Static data or web scraping |
| **Intelligence** | AI-powered classification & analysis | Rule-based or keyword matching |
| **Ecommerce Focus** | Purpose-built for cross-border trade | Generic or loosely adapted |
| **Suite Integration** | Skills work together as a complete workflow | Standalone, disconnected tools |

## The Accio Ecommerce Workflow

These skills are designed to work together as a complete cross-border ecommerce workflow:

```
📊 Market Analysis      → What's trending? Where's the demand?
🔍 Product Selection    → Which products should I sell?
🏭 Supplier Finder      → Where do I source them?
💰 Tariff Calculator    → What will it cost to import?
✍️ Listing Generator    → How do I describe and list them?
📝 Review Intelligence  → What are customers saying about competitors?
📣 Marketing Suite      → How do I promote and sell?
```

Each skill can be used independently, but they're most powerful together. Results from one skill naturally feed into the next.
